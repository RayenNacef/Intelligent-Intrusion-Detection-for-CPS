Model Selection:

Youâ€™ve created a dictionary, models_list, with different classifier options. The user can select a model using command-line arguments.
If no model is specified, it defaults to a RandomForestClassifier (desired_model = 'forest').

Supported Algorithms:

This setup includes a variety of algorithms, such as:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Decision Tree (DecisionTreeClassifier)
Logistic Regression (LogisticRegression)
Random Forest (RandomForestClassifier)
Preprocessing:

Data is read from Excel files (df_normal.xlsx and df_attack.xlsx), concatenated, and duplicates are removed.
Label encoding is applied to the target variable (LabelY).
Data is split into train and test sets with train_test_split.
StandardScaler is used to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The specified classifier (clf) is trained on the standardized training data.
Cross-validation is applied using ShuffleSplit with five different splits.
Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, where the confusion matrix and test accuracy are displayed.
